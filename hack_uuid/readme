UUID Issue 

When OCRA is used to bundle the uuid gem with an application, it does not carry the gemspec file
Line 63 of uuid.rb reads the gemspec file and pulls the version number out of that.  
With that file missing it causes the load error and the app to crash.

tempary fix: replace uuid with one that changes the version number to a string number in the file.
